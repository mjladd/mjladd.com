From <a href="http://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm?entry=12714" target="_self">Robert Fripp</a>:

"We are only ready to undertake a piece of work when we have completed that piece of work. Doing the task prepares us to do the task: we are learning on the job. So, clearly, we don’t understand how to do the job until we’ve already done it."

It always drove me nuts to attempt to estimate time for project managers.  Estimates would be tossed out with no basis in reality and I could only say "I don't know." A best guess is as useful as no guess at all. Project management seems like a weak use of the term 'management' but there's lots of pretty pictures, charts and numbers to make folks warm and fuzzy.

Things are done when they are done.  When <a href="http://www.betweenthecities.com/blog/ljr/" target="_self">Scott</a> was my boss he pointed this out often and I have yet to see any contrary evidence.
