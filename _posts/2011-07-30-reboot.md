With the home purchase and wedding planning going on, there's been little time left for anything else. I've been doing my best to keep up with my reading projects and making sure I hit the gym 3x a week, but anything else has pretty much been ignored. 

As things have settled down and with the year half-over, it's time to reboot and replan. I have a hard time feeling like I'm making any progress without some structure. So this week has been spent with pile of books, a yellow legal pad and things.app. I have a pretty good idea of how the rest of the year should work out in terms of goals. 

I'm also happy to get a big project started at work, something I've been working towards for the past few years. This will be a good opportunity to show off my ideas and prove that they work.
