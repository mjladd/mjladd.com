Pretty good weekend, good to get away from thinking about work. With system administration, there's always the worry that something will break, and I'll miss an alert, and work will be a nightmare the moment I walk in. Being a small company, every little thing falls into either my lap, or James'. 

Phil came by and we got some decent Asian food and hung out for a bit playing cards. I threw 'Clerks' on the DVD player for background noise. I hadn't seen it in awhile, but it brought back a few memories. I was lucky enough to be in school at a time when independent film was getting a bit of acclaim. 'Pulp Fiction', 'Killing Zoe', and 'Clerks' came out in 1994 when I was living in my first apartment. I was able to catch other films like 'Roger and Me', 'Slacker', and 'Go Fish' on video. I was lucky enough to have a roommate who was a film minor and got me into films such as 'Man Bites Dog', 'Delicatessen' , and the work of Kieslowski ('Trois Couleurs') and Errol Morris ('Thin Blue Line'). 

I feel lucky since it was a time when independent music was still getting some acclaim and independent film was really taking off. It was a good time to be in school, and around folks who had similar interests.
