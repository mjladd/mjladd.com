Had some personal days to use, so Jen and I headed downtown today. Had a fantastic day, gorgeous weather, good food, no complaints at all. Had a great breakfast at 'Orange': fruit sushi, cinnamon roll pancakes, and fruit kabob.

We checked out the Apple Store on Michigan Ave, and walked down to Millenium Park and caught part of an orchestra rehearsal. It was a great day off, something I haven't had since November. 

Tomorrow the family is coming up for graduation and the brother will be staying around for another couple of days. I'm assuming a fair amount of pizza will be consumed, including a possible visit to pizza fest in Lincoln Park.
