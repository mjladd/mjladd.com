Spent too much time moving this over from wordpress to jekyll, but I did take the time to pull together a bunch of old entries from other blogs. It was a trip to go back and read through stuff well over ten years old and then promptly dump most of it. 

I have a half-dozen wanna-be articles ready to be written, now that I'm done poking around the config side I need to sit down and do the hard part of actually writing.
