Summary:

1993 was an incredible year for finally having the chance to read so many authors that I've only heard about. I remember spending my typical Friday evenings at college at the Library until it closed at 7:00 pm, and then heading home with a pile of books by Hunter Thompson, Hubert Selby, or Charles Bukowski. I would hole up in my dorm room with a fresh pot of coffee and read for four to five hours before heading out for more typical college fun. During the summer of '93 I worked at a golf course, where I would spend my lunch break reading 'Tropic of Cancer' and 'McTeague' while listening to AM radio in a gigantic, 1976 Black Cutlass Supreme.
