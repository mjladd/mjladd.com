Terence Blanchard's 'A Tale of God's Will' is my favorite jazz recording of last year, and probably in my top five music purchases as well.  It reminds me of Pat Metheny's 'Secret Story' in it's scope and ambition. Its difficult to marry the jazz ethos alongside a symphonic score, but Blanchard does an amazing job, without becoming sappy or overdone.
