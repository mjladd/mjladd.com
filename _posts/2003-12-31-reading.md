Summary:

2003 was the year I finally got back into Literature. There were even several short trips to Indianapolis to load up on used books. The end of my work days were usually spent at a bookstore, either studying or reading. I remember being in school and thinking just how happy I would be to make enough money to afford coffee and a book whenever I wanted.
