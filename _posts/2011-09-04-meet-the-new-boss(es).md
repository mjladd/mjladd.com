For the last five years I've been pretty serious about weightlifting. Aside from a month off following surgery I never went a week without a minimum of three-days of weight-training and often went 4-5 days a week (which a short period of doing two-a-days when Jen was out of town). 

Getting older has made recovery times slower and a couple of injuries are forcing me to slow down. I'm committed to taking time off now that will allow me to return to heavier lifting in about a year. My goal is to continue lifting until at least 45 yrs old. I've hit most of my lifting goals with the exception of a 500 lb deadlift (I was at least two years away from that). 

So now I'm going to focus on recovery and conditioning with two of my new best friends; the kettlebell and interval timer. Rather than pulling 400 lbs off the floor, I'm struggling to perform a 45 lb turkish get up and doing timed kettlebell swings. It really is an ego check. 

Over the last few months, I've dropped 28 lbs and I'll likely have to shop for new clothes since I'm starting to swim in my own shirts. It sucks, but I'm making the best of it. It's a minor bump and will soon fade.
