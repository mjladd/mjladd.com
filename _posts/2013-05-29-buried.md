Probably the most difficult life adjustment I've had to make with the little on is accepting that I have to cut corners in everything I do. Every meal has to be cooked as quickly as possible. There's no time to clean up a paint job, or make another pass at weeding a flowerbed. Life is completely timeboxed and if I want to take more than and hour or so on something I have to get up earlier or stay up later. 

It is a constant reminder of perfection being the enemy of good, but most of the time I feel like most things end up half-assed and I'm not proud of the results. It is similiar to being pulled in too many directions at work. One can stay afloat, but they won't get much closer to shore.
