Summary:
Since I had accumulated a huge backlog of unread books, I had planned out my reading for the entire year. A minimum of a book a week.


Update:
I got dragged down by a couple of slow books (I'm looking at you Thomas Friedman) and school took up a lot of time, I missed by goal by about 14 books.
