Brutal cold today (2 degrees this morning), but i think last night was worse (-19 wind chill).

Had a great time last night seeing Henry Rollins in Chicago. Pretty solid show. It's good to see the changes over the years in his performances. A tough 1.5 hr wait in single digit temperature, but worth it, since we were only three rows back and dead cente.

It was a fantastic drive homeward, right through the city with it's amazing buildings all lit up and gorgeous. 

Pretty awake all things considered, all things being two consistant nights of 4hrs of sleep, but that's ok. Soon coffee will be brewing and all will be well.
