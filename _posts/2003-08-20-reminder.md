Had a good reminder the other day, a nice email that reminded me of a big decision made, and how so correct it was. I took a big chance, and it didn't really work out at the time, but things have fallen in place much better than I had ever thought they would.

Looking back on the past year of work I really managed to get a lot accomplished. I knocked out the Solaris Certifications and am a MCSE. I achieved most of my goals in regards to network security and feel much better about the state of the company security. There are few things left to do, but I think I'll be moving on before long. I'm really looking forward about moving to Chicago. I used to keep a deskop background of the Chicago skyline as a reminder of how much I wanted to live in the city. The access to that much art and music really excites me. Hopefully things will fall into place before long, and I'll be on to the next stage of my life. I had a lot of support from my friends, and am very thankful for the opportunities I've been given.
