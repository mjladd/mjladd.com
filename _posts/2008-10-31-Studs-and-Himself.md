With the passing of Studs Terkel and DFW last month, Mr. Terkel's quote is very apt.

> "With optimism, you look upon the sunny side of things. People say, 'Studs, you're an optimist.' I never said I was an optimist. I have hope because what's the alternative to hope? Despair? If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven."
