Started reading this last night, and it immediately took my back to my hometown. Michael has returned to his hometown and becomes a volunteer fireman. It's a book that I wish I had an afternoon to lose myself in.

Edit: I really like this line.

"Working-class prejudice never quite shakes the idea of art as frivolity, and frivolity has pink-palms."

Coming from a small town, this was always something rolling around in my head while I was studying music. How useless it would seem at times.Â  I still have similar feelings about IT, questioning if I should be doing something that may have a more positive impact.
