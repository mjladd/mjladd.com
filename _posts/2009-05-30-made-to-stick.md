Finished 'Made to Stick' the other day. Solid read, like Gladwell without the arrogance but with some practicality. 

I like the way that the authors emphasis the use of 'the story' and how much more effective and 'sticky' concepts are when they are built into a story. 

They break 'stickiness' into five concepts: simple, unexpected, concrete, emotional and stories. There are definitive examples within each concept that effectively help ideas adhere become easier to recall.  I've suffered through a fair number of 'biz' book but this one was pretty great. 

This copy was from the library, but I need to pick up a copy for myself to highlight and underline and scribble over.
