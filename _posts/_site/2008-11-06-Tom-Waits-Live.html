<p>There&#8217;s a very short list of musicians that I care to see live. The live environment involves people, and people generally ruin everything. Tom Waits is on that very short list. I&#8217;ve been a fan of Mr. Waits since the fall of 1992, borrowing a tape of &#8216;Bone Machine&#8217; from Jason Guski (sp?) and reveling in the harshness of &#8216;Earth Died Screaming&#8217; and &#8216;Goin out West&#8217; as well as the heartbreaking performances of &#8216;Little Rain&#8217; and &#8216;Who Are You&#8217;. I went on to accumulate the entire Wait&#8217;s collection. Mr. Waits&#8217; music has always been with me.</p>

<p>Note: while waiting for the show to start, we noticed a gentleman taking the stairs to the upper balcony dressed in an old suit, with a full beard and his hair wrapped in a clip to to the back of his head. I said to my brother, &#8220;That&#8217;s Jim James.&#8221; The lead singer for My Morning Jacket was there, and we actually had better seats then he had. It took a bit of restraint to not go and become an annoying fanboy (MMJ is one of my top five bands at the moment, and their work gets better with every release).</p>

<p>It was a great show and I feel very lucky to have been able to see him live. The duet performance (piano and bass) of &#8216;Tom Traubert&#8217;s Blues&#8217; was incredible, the audience became silent and and reverential and I&#8217;m sure there were a few tears shed during that tune.</p>
