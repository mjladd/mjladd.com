<p>Had some personal days to use, so Jen and I headed downtown today. Had a fantastic day, gorgeous weather, good food, no complaints at all. Had a great breakfast at &#8216;Orange&#8217;: fruit sushi, cinnamon roll pancakes, and fruit kabob.</p>

<p>We checked out the Apple Store on Michigan Ave, and walked down to Millenium Park and caught part of an orchestra rehearsal. It was a great day off, something I haven&#8217;t had since November.</p>

<p>Tomorrow the family is coming up for graduation and the brother will be staying around for another couple of days. I&#8217;m assuming a fair amount of pizza will be consumed, including a possible visit to pizza fest in Lincoln Park.</p>
