<blockquote>
<p>Until one is committed, there is hesitancy. the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness concerning all acts of initiative (and creation). There is one elemental truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans - - - that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves all. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issue from the decision, raising in one&#8217;s favor all manner of incidents and meetings and material assistance which no one could have dreamed would come his or her way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whatever you can do or dream, you can begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now.</p>
