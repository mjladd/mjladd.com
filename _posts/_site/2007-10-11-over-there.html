<p>Last night at home with Jen, we had the Jazz cable music channel on while she was reading and I was working on the laptop. I heard &#8220;Over There&#8221; by Terence Blanchard and was stunned. I sat starting and the awful slideshow displayed by the channel and listened to the 7+ minute tune without moving. It&#8217;s rare that I hear much newer Jazz that hits me like this did. Afterwards, it was a quick visit to the Amazon MP3 store and I was all set. I&#8217;ve listened to the entire project &#8220;A Tale of God&#8217;s Will (Requiem for Katrina)&#8221; twice now and the tune &#8220;Over There&#8221; at least six times. It&#8217;s an amazing work, and I&#8217;m lucky that I came across it. I&#8217;ve been too busy with work and school to keep up with much new music, and most of my time listening to Jazz involves making my way through a hundred or so John Coltrane projects and bootlegs.</p>
