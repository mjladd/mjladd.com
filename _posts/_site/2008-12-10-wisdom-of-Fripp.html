<p>From <a href='http://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm?entry=12714' target='_self'>Robert Fripp</a>:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are only ready to undertake a piece of work when we have completed that piece of work. Doing the task prepares us to do the task: we are learning on the job. So, clearly, we don’t understand how to do the job until we’ve already done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It always drove me nuts to attempt to estimate time for project managers.  Estimates would be tossed out with no basis in reality and I could only say &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; A best guess is as useful as no guess at all. Project management seems like a weak use of the term &#8216;management&#8217; but there&#8217;s lots of pretty pictures, charts and numbers to make folks warm and fuzzy.</p>

<p>Things are done when they are done.  When <a href='http://www.betweenthecities.com/blog/ljr/' target='_self'>Scott</a> was my boss he pointed this out often and I have yet to see any contrary evidence.</p>
