<p>After finishing the last music project, I was starting off the year wallowing with a lack of plans. From all the time spent in school, I seem to work better with a plan that involves projects ramping up and down. Without it, it just feels like one endless stream of days and I end up like David Byrne, &#8220;My god, how did I get here?&#8221;. I need the list of tasks checked off and projects complete to assure myself that I&#8217;m not wasting time.</p>

<p>Getting my crap together generally involves one very long text file of all the books I want to read and projects I want to do. These get pared down into reasonable tasks that go into whatever I&#8217;m using to track work (so for &#8216;Things.app&#8217; has held that place for two years, but I&#8217;m positive I&#8217;ll just go back to a todo.txt).</p>

<p>It was good to have a bit of break over the holidays and spend time with Jen. I feel like I got a nice bit of inertia going with the last music project and I to take advantage of that and work on some projects that I need a lot more motivation to get myself to do.</p>
