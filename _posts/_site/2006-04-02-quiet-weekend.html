<p>Pretty good weekend, good to get away from thinking about work. With system administration, there&#8217;s always the worry that something will break, and I&#8217;ll miss an alert, and work will be a nightmare the moment I walk in. Being a small company, every little thing falls into either my lap, or James&#8217;.</p>

<p>Phil came by and we got some decent Asian food and hung out for a bit playing cards. I threw &#8216;Clerks&#8217; on the DVD player for background noise. I hadn&#8217;t seen it in awhile, but it brought back a few memories. I was lucky enough to be in school at a time when independent film was getting a bit of acclaim. &#8216;Pulp Fiction&#8217;, &#8216;Killing Zoe&#8217;, and &#8216;Clerks&#8217; came out in 1994 when I was living in my first apartment. I was able to catch other films like &#8216;Roger and Me&#8217;, &#8216;Slacker&#8217;, and &#8216;Go Fish&#8217; on video. I was lucky enough to have a roommate who was a film minor and got me into films such as &#8216;Man Bites Dog&#8217;, &#8216;Delicatessen&#8217; , and the work of Kieslowski (&#8216;Trois Couleurs&#8217;) and Errol Morris (&#8216;Thin Blue Line&#8217;).</p>

<p>I feel lucky since it was a time when independent music was still getting some acclaim and independent film was really taking off. It was a good time to be in school, and around folks who had similar interests.</p>
