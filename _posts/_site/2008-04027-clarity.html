<p>I missed nearly a month of gym time due to shoulder surgery, but I tried to be in the best possible shape going into the procedure. Over the summer I did nearly two months of two-a-day workouts and lifted up until the day of getting sliced (8/10/07). Just about a month later (9/6/07) I was ok&#8217;d to go back to the gym, and went in 20 lbs lighter and much weaker. During the month out of the gym I walked with my arm in a sling and did rehab exercises 3-5 times a day, but it was nothing compared to having 300 lbs on the bar.</p>

<p>It helps to look back and see progress. It&#8217;s easy to frustrated, and let the ego get in the way when I feel like I&#8217;m not progressing fast enough. I&#8217;m pretty happy with the fact that during the entire time in school, I missed maybe 1-2 weeks of workouts. Five weeks left of class, and I&#8217;m ready hit the gym even harder. It&#8217;s the one thing in life that keeps me sane, its the one activity that gives back exactly what you put into it.</p>
