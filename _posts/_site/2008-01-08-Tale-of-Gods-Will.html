<p>Terence Blanchard&#8217;s &#8216;A Tale of God&#8217;s Will&#8217; is my favorite jazz recording of last year, and probably in my top five music purchases as well.  It reminds me of Pat Metheny&#8217;s &#8216;Secret Story&#8217; in it&#8217;s scope and ambition. Its difficult to marry the jazz ethos alongside a symphonic score, but Blanchard does an amazing job, without becoming sappy or overdone. </p>
