<p>The new Donald Fagen project &#8216;Morph the Cat&#8217; came out today and now I&#8217;m happily grooving to Mr. Fagen&#8217;s music.</p>

<p>There were two events that finally got me into the music of Steely Dan and Messrs. Fagen and Becker. I was driving back to college during a time when I nothing more to listen to than FM radio. I feel completely spoiled today with a CD player or iPod my vehicle, but I did have several lucky occurrences from scanning the radio dial. I was on a length of highway 28 and caught a morning show that was featuring the music of Steely Dan. I managed to catch about 30 minutes of the show and heard such tunes as &#8216;Babylon Sisters&#8217;, &#8216;Hey Nineteen&#8217;, and &#8216;FM&#8217;. After getting back to the lowly college apartment, I borrowed the roommate&#8217;s Citizen Steely Dan boxed set and became a fan.</p>

<p>Sometime over that winter break, I had a lot of time on my hands (I believe this was pre-computer days) and spent most of a week when not tending bar, doing nothing but laying on our $25 Goodwill couch and reading. I loaded up the CD player with all four discs from the boxed set and spent a good part of each day absorbing the jazz influenced melodies and impeccable studio chops of the band.</p>

<p>I occasionally get locked into musical patterns when I&#8217;m stuck on an artist and listen to nothing but their entire catalog for weeks on end. This happens with artists such as &#8216;Wilco&#8217; or &#8216;John Coltrane&#8217;, but at least once a year I load up the mp3 player with every bit of Steely Dan, Donald Fagen, and Walter Becker music that I have.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s too early to judge the newest project, but it sounds like vintage Fagen, so I think I&#8217;ll be quite content.</p>
