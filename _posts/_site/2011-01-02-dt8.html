<p>I finished <a href='http://www.mjladd.com/music'>DT8</a> over vacation. It was written in fits and starts over the last three/four months in quick chunks whenever I could grab some time. Mostly written in the early morning hours when I couldn&#8217;t sleep (2:30-5am mostly and a few rushed lunch hours at home).</p>

<p>This was the first time I spend the cash and starting adding live instruments to the recordings.</p>
