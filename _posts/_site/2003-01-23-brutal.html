<p>Brutal cold today (2 degrees this morning), but i think last night was worse (-19 wind chill).</p>

<p>Had a great time last night seeing Henry Rollins in Chicago. Pretty solid show. It&#8217;s good to see the changes over the years in his performances. A tough 1.5 hr wait in single digit temperature, but worth it, since we were only three rows back and dead cente.</p>

<p>It was a fantastic drive homeward, right through the city with it&#8217;s amazing buildings all lit up and gorgeous.</p>

<p>Pretty awake all things considered, all things being two consistant nights of 4hrs of sleep, but that&#8217;s ok. Soon coffee will be brewing and all will be well.</p>
