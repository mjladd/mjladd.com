<p>Liquid error: No such file or directory - /Users/mjladd/src/mjladd.com/_posts/_includes Had a good reminder the other day, a nice email that reminded me of a big decision made, and how so correct it was. I took a big chance, and it didn&#8217;t really work out at the time, but things have fallen in place much better than I had ever thought they would.</p>

<p>Looking back on the past year of work I really managed to get a lot accomplished. I knocked out the Solaris Certifications and am a MCSE. I achieved most of my goals in regards to network security and feel much better about the state of the company security. There are few things left to do, but I think I&#8217;ll be moving on before long. I&#8217;m really looking forward about moving to Chicago. I used to keep a deskop background of the Chicago skyline as a reminder of how much I wanted to live in the city. The access to that much art and music really excites me. Hopefully things will fall into place before long, and I&#8217;ll be on to the next stage of my life. I had a lot of support from my friends, and am very thankful for the opportunities I&#8217;ve been given.</p>
