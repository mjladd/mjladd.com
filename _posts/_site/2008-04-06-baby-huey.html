<p>Been listening to a lot of funk and soul music. I like digging up artists from obscure areas of the US where I never imagined funk to emerge. Listening to &#8216;The Baby Huey Story: The Living Legend &#8217; right now. Nice touch, James &#8220;Baby Huey&#8221; Rame was born in Richmond, IN (which if I remember correctly became the home for one of the Graham Brothers) and moved to Chicago at nineteen.</p>

<p>Baby Huey was 400 pounds of soul, with a great voice and apparently impressive stage presence. The horn lines, particularly in &#8216;Listen to Me&#8217;, remind me of some horn work from Frank Zappa. The cover of &#8216;A Change is Gonna Come&#8217; is probably unnecessary, it&#8217;s pretty hard to match the original.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been collecting a big list of funk/soul compilations lately and have another 15 or so queued up for purchase.</p>
