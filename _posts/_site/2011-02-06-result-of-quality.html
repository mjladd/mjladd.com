<p>I&#8217;ve been on a big David Simon kick since I&#8217;ve been re-watching &#8216;The Wire&#8217; with Jen. Although it took me a few episodes to dig in when I watched it the first time, I (like many folks) became enamored without the show. Critical acclaim naming the best TV Series ever is not to be dismissed.</p>

<p>The side affect of &#8220;The Wire&#8221; (for myself) is being unable to watch any other cop-related programming without a fair amount of teeth gritting at the low quality writing and ridiculous plot lines.</p>

<p>Simon&#8217;s show &#8220;Generation Kill&#8221; had the same effect on me when attempting to watch &#8220;The Green Zone&#8221;. Generation Kill showed a view of the Iraq War from an embedded journalist and how misconstrued so many of the efforts were. The voices of the soldiers felt real and true. Hearing lines like &#8220;Get your game face on&#8221; from Matt Damon in &#8220;The Green Zone&#8221; just made me wince. I made it about 30 minutes before giving up.</p>

<p>From a technical nerd standpoint, I love the way that Simon (or rather the directors he chooses) uses sound and visuals. Music is very rarely used unless it comes from a real source; a car radio, or music appropriate for the environment. GZ (like many hollywood films) uses silly, obvious music to tell you exactly how you should feel, &#8220;this is tension, this is drama&#8221; rather than letting the actors tell the story. GZ also uses the nausea inducing shaky-cam which makes me physically bothered (I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised, the director, Paul Greengrass made the unwatchable Bourne films) . David Simon uses the camera to highlight the content and not obscure it. With few exceptions, Simon focuses on story above all.</p>

<p>The results of quality is showing how far the bar can be raising by demonstrating the results of a valiant effort and commitment to telling a story in the truest way possible. &#8220;The Green Zone&#8221; was a hackneyed story with mediocre performances.</p>
