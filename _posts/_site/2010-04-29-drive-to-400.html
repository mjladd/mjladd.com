<p>Every year I come up with a crazy workout goal to keep things interesting. A couple of years ago it was going through Eric Cresey&#8217;s plan and last year it was going through Dave Tate&#8217;s Strong(e)r workout series (which ironically didn&#8217;t leave me stronger, but I think it did improve overall physical fitness).</p>

<p>These are the totals from the last time I tested max lifts.</p>

<pre><code>Bench    335
Squat    375
Deadlift 385
        1095</code></pre>

<p>This year I want to push those three lifts to either hit or get close to 400 lbs.</p>

<pre><code>Bench    365
Squat    405
Deadlift 425
        1195 - Just shy of the 1200 lb club</code></pre>

<p>Not great numbers for a powerlifter, but not awful for a mid-30s computer geek.</p>

<p>The workout plan will be close to Wendler&#8217;s 5-3-1 workout with an emphasis on assistance exercises that focus on grip strength (my biggest deadlift weakness) and lower-back health. I&#8217;m codetty confident in the squat and deadlift goals, but benching makes me nervous since I don&#8217;t have a spotter. Once you get 300+ lbs balanced over your throat you better be codetty confident that you&#8217;ll be able to push it back up.</p>
