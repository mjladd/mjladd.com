<p>Taking the day off tomorrow, been working about 11 days straight after last weekend&#8217;s domain move fiasco. The weather&#8217;s been pretty amazing, springlike (mid 70s) and quite comfortable.</p>

<p>Took off an hour early after fighting with the president&#8217;s workstation. It was fantastic to drive home with the windows down and the new Wilco CD (A Ghost is Born) at full volume.</p>

<p>Aside from work, the rest of life is starting to settle into place. It&#8217;s nice to have the health club membership for stress release and high-speed internet for getting work done.</p>

<p>Jen and I are heading east to visit the folks this weekend. I have a few things left to drag back to the new homestead. Hopefully tomorrow will be productive, I haven&#8217;t had a full day to myself in a long time.</p>
