<p>Started the day by visiting the nearby Harley Davidson factory in Kansas City. I&#8217;m not a bike person, but I appreciate craftsmanship and HD&#8217;s ability to gardner customer loyalty.</p>

<ul>
<li>all workers who drive HDs park in the very front of the building, there is a lot of pride in showing off their personal machines&lt;/ul&gt;</li>

<li>HD managers and factor workers and undistinguishable, they all wear identical clothing (mostly HD gear but it is not required) the only tie I saw was worn by a visitor</li>

<li>managers and workers use the same dining area and parking</li>

<li>managers and union leaders share the same office space</li>

<li>plant workers in different cells are responsible for self-organizing and prioritizing duties</li>

<li>all workers in each cell are required to switch off every job, every worker knows every duty of the job</li>

<li>robots are cool, lots of precision robot work is performed, but hand-checked by humans</li>
</ul>

<p>After the trip to HD, we hunted down a local bookstore (Prospero&#8217;s) where Jen found a couple of treasures and then walked around downtown KC. We found the library, which has a really impressive display of large books that decorate the outside of the library&#8217;s parking structure.<br /><img alt='kc_06' title='kc_06' src='/images/kc_06-300x225.jpg' width='300' height='225' class='alignnone size-medium wp-image-521' /></p>

<p>We also found a neat little market and picked up some fruit. <img alt='kc_09' title='kc_09' src='/images/kc_09-300x225.jpg' width='300' height='225' class='alignnone size-medium wp-image-522' /></p>

<p>We headed back to the hotel and walked over to the crown center where we had a really unremarkable lunch. We took and hour or so out to check email and catch up with the outside world. <br /></p>

<p>We headed out to Kauffman Stadium to see the White Sox vs the Royals. It lives in a sport&#8217;s complex similar to Philadelphia where there is a baseball stadium next to a football stadium, etc .. It was really out in the middle of nowhere with nothing around it. It felt a lot more like a nice minor-league stadium. Burhle pitched a great game and we had great seats, nothing could have been better.</p>
