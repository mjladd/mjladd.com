<p>Last.fm = 445 different artists in the last 12 months. The idea of statically listening to the same music over and over until I die sound miserable. It&#8217;s like reading the same ten books over-and-over and just letting a part of my brain shrivel away. There&#8217;s too much good stuff out there to ignore. I need to keep my mind open and my preconceived notions buried away. I&#8217;m glad that I use something like last.fm to remind myself to keep looking and keep searching for new music.</p>
