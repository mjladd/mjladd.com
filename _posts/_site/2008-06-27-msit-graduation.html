<p>Last Friday I graduated from the <a href='http://infotech.northwestern.edu'>MSIT</a> program at Northwestern. It&#8217;s took too years and way too much money, but it&#8217;s over. It certainly wasn&#8217;t every I hoped for, but it&#8217;s over. Coming from a tiny town in Indiana, I never thought I would ever graduate from any university of any renown (BM and MM from Ball State). It was a personal success in that regard.</p>

<p>I now have my Saturdays free, and am looking forward to taking my first vacation in several years.Â  Having your weekends halved, and many nights spent doing homework left for very little free time.</p>
