<p>I didn&#8217;t reach my &#8216;Road to 400 Goals&#8217; but I did end the year with a personal record for deadlift and weighted in 10 lbs lighter by the end of the year. Most of my lifts remained the same or went up, so I&#8217;m happy to have retained muscle mass while loosing a bit of extra weight.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;ve been doing so much heavy work, I&#8217;m going to start off the year with a couple months of high-rep, low-weight work with an emphasis on getting my heart rate up.</p>
<strong>Reading</strong>
<p>51 books this year, not all of them winners, but as I get older I&#8217;m getting better at cutting out the garbage quicker. It&#8217;s easy to tell the time of year based on what I&#8217;m reading, more serious work during the start/end of the year and light stuff over the summer.</p>

<strong>Music: Written</strong>
<p>I put out three EPs and one full project of music this year, (about 108 minutes of sound). I&#8217;m pretty happy with the output and I see a lot of change and progress.</p>
<strong>Next Year:</strong>
<p>I already have a reading list about 15 items deep. For music I want to get back into Max/MSP and build more interactive processing in Reaktor. I also have a pile of Abersold jazz books that I should spend more time with. The older I get the more I feel a need to dig deeper into harmony.</p>
