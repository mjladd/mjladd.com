<p>Just finished watched the latest Errol Morris film, Fog of War. Morris&#8217; films are always compelling, he has a definite knack for discovering worthy subjects. This time the subject was Robert McNamara.</p>

<p>I do hope that at the age of 85, I have some semblance of coherence and memory that Mr. McNamara retains.</p>

<p>&#8220;At my age, 85, I&#8217;m at an age where I can look back and derive some conclusions about my actions. My rule has been to try to learn, try to understand what happened. Develop the lessons and pass them on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Over the course of the film, MacNamara discusses his viewpoint and roles in some of the greatest events in American History; WWI, The Cold War, The Cuban Missile Crisis, The Vietnam War, and the past and future implications of Nuclear Weapons.</p>

<p>The film is organized around eleven lessons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Empathize with your enemy</li>

<li>Rationality will not save us</li>

<li>There&#8217;s something beyond one&#8217;s self</li>

<li>Maximize efficiency</li>

<li>Proportionality should be a guideline in war</li>

<li>Get the data</li>

<li>Belief and Seeing are both often wrong</li>

<li>Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning</li>

<li>In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil</li>

<li>Never say never</li>

<li>You can&#8217;t change human nature</li>
</ul>

<p>It was pretty amazing how he coldly he could discuss the ending of thousands of lives in war and yet tear up when discussing the assassination of President Kennedy. I imagine one has to be able to distance oneself from the realties of human loss through statistics and rationalizations.</p>

<p>&#8220;The primary role of the President of the United States is to keep the nation out of war&#8221; - J.F. Kennedy</p>
