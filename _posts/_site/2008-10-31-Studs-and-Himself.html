<p>With the passing of Studs Terkel and DFW last month, Mr. Terkel&#8217;s quote is very apt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;With optimism, you look upon the sunny side of things. People say, &#8216;Studs, you&#8217;re an optimist.&#8217; I never said I was an optimist. I have hope because what&#8217;s the alternative to hope? Despair? If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven.&#8221;</p>
