<p>The last session of the first day was on &#8216;Protecting Your Software Investment&#8217;. The description of the session follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Patching, Security (Internal and External) , Speed of Access, Disaster Preparedness, Data Recovery, Backup Options&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for anything related to disaster recovery and security, so no matter how badly I really wanted to leave so I could go home and pass out in a Nyquil induced haze, I forced myself to attend. I was graciously rewarded with fountains of knowledge. While there was 75 minutes set aside for the presentation, it was drawn out to a painful 24 minutes.</p>

<p>Play-by-play:</p>

<ul>
<li>patching: only apply if necessary, so, uh, if not necessary, don&#8217;t apply</li>

<li>security: use some antivirus product</li>

<li>speed of access: if things are slow, upgrade to gigabit</li>

<li>disaster preparedness: have a disaster recovery plan (described as, &#8220;a list of things to do to recover in case of disaster&#8221;)</li>

<li>data recovery: make backups</li>

<li>backup options: not discussed</li>
</ul>

<p>There was no discussion of how to patch, how to determine what constitutes a necessary patch, example DR plans, backup rotations, etc.</p>

<p>Ok, I need to let it go. It was only two days of my life gone to pot.</p>
