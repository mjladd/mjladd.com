<p>Finished &#8216;Made to Stick&#8217; the other day. Solid read, like Gladwell without the arrogance but with some practicality.</p>

<p>I like the way that the authors emphasis the use of &#8216;the story&#8217; and how much more effective and &#8216;sticky&#8217; concepts are when they are built into a story.</p>

<p>They break &#8216;stickiness&#8217; into five concepts: simple, unexpected, concrete, emotional and stories. There are definitive examples within each concept that effectively help ideas adhere become easier to recall. I&#8217;ve suffered through a fair number of &#8216;biz&#8217; book but this one was pretty great.</p>

<p>This copy was from the library, but I need to pick up a copy for myself to highlight and underline and scribble over.</p>
