<p>For the last five years I&#8217;ve been pretty serious about weightlifting. Aside from a month off following surgery I never went a week without a minimum of three-days of weight-training and often went 4-5 days a week (which a short period of doing two-a-days when Jen was out of town).</p>

<p>Getting older has made recovery times slower and a couple of injuries are forcing me to slow down. I&#8217;m committed to taking time off now that will allow me to return to heavier lifting in about a year. My goal is to continue lifting until at least 45 yrs old. I&#8217;ve hit most of my lifting goals with the exception of a 500 lb deadlift (I was at least two years away from that).</p>

<p>So now I&#8217;m going to focus on recovery and conditioning with two of my new best friends; the kettlebell and interval timer. Rather than pulling 400 lbs off the floor, I&#8217;m struggling to perform a 45 lb turkish get up and doing timed kettlebell swings. It really is an ego check.</p>

<p>Over the last few months, I&#8217;ve dropped 28 lbs and I&#8217;ll likely have to shop for new clothes since I&#8217;m starting to swim in my own shirts. It sucks, but I&#8217;m making the best of it. It&#8217;s a minor bump and will soon fade.</p>
