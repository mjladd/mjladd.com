<p>Heading out in the morning for the big east coast trip. Three/Four cities in one week (Boston, DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia). It is the first vacation we&#8217;ve been able to take in nearly three years, so I&#8217;m pretty excited. It&#8217;ll be nice to be able to visit with friends as well.</p>

<p>The worse thing about AM flights is that I can never sleep well. I&#8217;ll probably end up waking up 5-6 times and being unable to sleep on the flight. The iphone is loaded with enough music, tv shows, and Ted presentations to keep me occupied, along with a 600 page Hunter S. Thompson book (&#8216;72 Campaign, to keep in the spirit of visiting DC).</p>
