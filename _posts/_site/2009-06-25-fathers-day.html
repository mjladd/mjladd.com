<p>I really like this photo of my grandparents at the Indiana Dunes. I think it was from when they were both in high school or just out.</p>

<p>Also from high school, my grandfather and a friend of his skipped school one day and made a road trip to Vassar College. They&#8217;re wearing their Roosevelt High School sweaters.</p>

<p>I like to remember my grandfather like this. He had a habit of working outside until tired and then taking a nap. He makes good use of a wheelbarrow.</p>
