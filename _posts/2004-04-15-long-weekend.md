Taking the day off tomorrow, been working about 11 days straight after last weekend's domain move fiasco. The weather's been pretty amazing, springlike (mid 70s) and quite comfortable.

Took off an hour early after fighting with the president's workstation. It was fantastic to drive home with the windows down and the new Wilco CD (A Ghost is Born) at full volume.

Aside from work, the rest of life is starting to settle into place. It's nice to have the health club membership for stress release and high-speed internet for getting work done. 

Jen and I are heading east to visit the folks this weekend. I have a few things left to drag back to the new homestead. Hopefully tomorrow will be productive, I haven't had a full day to myself in a long time.
