So I've survived another mind-numbing conference. Powerpoint is certainly the work of the devil, if for no other reason that it is very successful in making learning tedious. Session after session of green text on white templates, with monotonous speakers droning on about topics they care nothing about. 

I think I actually picked up two useful bits of knowledge that could have taken the sum total of 25 seconds, rather than two days. 

Favorite buzzwords/cliches (from a single 45 minute lecture):
- spark creativity
- create a bridge
- improve communications
- extending the power
- building a bridge


Most annoying tic:
- How many of you here are using version X?
- How many of you here are using version X.X?
- How many of you here are using software X and software Y?
- How many of you here enjoyed breakfast?

The last session I attended, this type of question was posed 34 times before I quit counting. The constant question asking/hand raising and NOBODY CARES about the responses. None of the content material is modified in regards to the audience responses. It's like grade school all over again.
