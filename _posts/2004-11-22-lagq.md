While browsing the local Sunday paper, I happend to see that the Los Angeles Guitar Quartet was performing in town that evening.

The concert was at the University of Chicago campus, w/ the poor directions we were given, we enjoyed a nice tour of the south-side of Chicago. There are a few rough areas down there. When we hit Comiskey Park, we don't even hit the local restaurants.

After a couple of detours, we managed to find street parking and grabbed a couple of available tix. Even feeling a bit old and out of place in the college environment, there were enough old folks so we didn't stand out too much.

They LAGQ played two nice sets, and were pretty tight for the most part. Some nice originals, and appropriate arrangements (aside from the Stravinsky, which doesn't seem to translate well to the guitar).

LAGQ is similar to the Kronos Quartet in the sense of being a bit more adventurous in their vocabulary then the standard ensembles.

I need to check out more music. There's always so much going on in this town, I need to make it more of a priority.
