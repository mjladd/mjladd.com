Thinking of how to keep my life in sync b/w work and home. Normally everything lives in a DevonThink database so all of my research is with me all the time. I've been trying to put more of my day-to-day notes and calendar stuff into .txt files and run the risk of forgetting to copy things back and forth to my USB key.

What I really want is for my /home to live on my iPod, so I can plug in and work, but that hasn't happened yet.

I'm looking into either using github or projectlocker and write a script toÂ  sync up when I log off/on multiple workstations. If my handwriting wasn't so slow (and illegible), I could probably go back to living in a notebook.
