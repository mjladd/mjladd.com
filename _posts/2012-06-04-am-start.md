Fine way to begin the week, all mornings should start this way. 

* 4:30 am - up -> check email/sites/iced tea/plan workout
* 5:00 am - stretching/workout
* 6:00 am - water plants/lawn (grass is sprouting and garden is showing some promise)
* 6:30 am - breakfast (sausage/bagel/hashbrowns/eggs/coffee/smoothie)
* 7:00 am - piano practice
* 7:30 am - prep for work (shower/pack/plan)
* 8:15 am - out the door

Bonus: new headphones at work w/ some degree of noise isolation may help save my sanity.
