Summary:

1999 was full of changes. I had finished off the masters program in a year and a half. I had committed to working at a music camp over the summer where I consumed the entire David Foster Wallace collection. I also spent some time traveling and finally had to make a career decision. Although I was accepted into a PhD program, I couldn't come up with the funds, so into IT I went. Since I had no real experience, I spent my time preparing for certification exams and finally got my first real job.
