    <p>I blew through Lipsky&#8217;s book on David Foster Wallace in two sittings. The times that Lipsky inserted himself or his thoughts was distracting, but it was great to dive into Wallace&#8217;s head for a nice chunk of time. I was happy with how ended, it would have been easy to be morose, but instead I was left with much happier memories. I like thinking about how much DFW was enjoying the process of writing and how he was looking forward to working for a good length of time.</p>

<p>I have six other books in progress right now, but I should knock out a couple of them this weekend. It&#8217;s slightly nutty, but I like the mix right now. I was planning to be working on more music this month, perhaps next week when Jen will be gone for a couple of days. Right now my evenings are nothing but a White Sox game on in the background and a book in hand. Things could be much, much worse.</p>

<p>Overall things seem pretty solid. Made some great progress at work and got rewarded for it, and today finished off a nice project that took longer than I hoped, but it was done the right way.</p>

<p>Yesterday someone at work asked how it is that I seem so happy all the time. I really didn&#8217;t know how to answer that. I feel like I&#8217;ve been pretty buried for awhile but it&#8217;s starting to burn off like fog. It comes and goes in waves, but right now things are well. It&#8217;s strange to be happy, but I never lose the feeling of other shoes dropping.</p>
