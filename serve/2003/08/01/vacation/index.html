    <p>ugh, such a trauma to return from vacation, experiencing something new everyday, not knowing what the day will bring, and then returning to a structured existence. The body and soul take a bit of time to adjust.</p>

<p>thursday (6/19) - leave from MDW to SEA (hurrah for direct flights), grab luggage and rental car (2003 chrysler sebring) and head northward to the town of Everett to stay at Kim &amp; Mike&#8217;s home for the evening</p>

<p>friday (6/20)</p>

<ul>
<li>breakfast w/ Kim and then northward towards Vancouver, B.C.</li>

<li>it&#8217;s good to see Kim and Mike again, glad he&#8217;s finally back from the Middle East, they seem to be doing very well, very happy for them</li>

<li>nice drive through the rain and gorgeous countryside, bit of a tense border crossing (intense men asking what we did for a living, best advised not to joke w/ these folks)</li>

<li>too early to check in, drive around trying to locate botanical gardens, instead opt for chinatown</li>

<li>very peaceful rain through most of the day, almost impossible to find public restrooms in vancouver</li>

<li>spend and hour fighting w/ streets that change names, but manage to locate the hotel (Century Plaza Hotel and Spa)</li>

<li>rest a bit, then have dinner in overpriced restaurant in hotel</li>
</ul>

<p>saturday (6/21)</p>

<ul>
<li>hit the local town, find the beach and watch the ships for hours</li>

<li>spend time in Kitsilano walking, walking, walking</li>

<li>great food at the &#8216;Restaurant from Hell&#8217;</li>

<li>try to make it to the vancouver canadians baseball time, but there&#8217;s nowhere to park</li>

<li>check out the downtown area near the hotel, can&#8217;t believe how clean this town is</li>

<li>dinner at a mediocrie thai restaurant</li>
</ul>

<p>sunday (6/22)</p>

<ul>
<li>head to granville island in the AM, pretty rainy so the crowds are mild</li>

<li>the market on the island is fantastic, i really want to live somewhere w/ access to this much fresh food</li>

<li>meet an older couple from alberta (?), very polite folks, very canadian</li>

<li>head to stanley park (1000 acres), discover that the aquarium is $17 and spend the time walking around the park instead. Very pretty area, the folks here are so polite. I feel like just another rude american here.</li>
</ul>

<p>monday (6/23)</p>

<ul>
<li>head south to seattle, find nathan &amp; jodi&#8217;s apt w/ some difficulty (again, raods changing names)</li>

<li>head out for thai food, used cd stores, public market, monorail</li>

<li>dinner at &#8216;chinook&#8217;s&#8217;, nice view of the boats on the water. I feel bad for any company when i&#8217;m around the water, i can just stare for hours. Being on the water is the only place i really feel relaxed.</li>
</ul>

<p>tuesday (6/24)</p>

<ul>
<li>out for breakfast (amazing coffee)</li>

<li>check out the zoo and a local beach. It would be so nice to be close enough to the beach to take one&#8217;s lunch break there</li>

<li>dinner in freemont, hit some used bookstores and pick up the new Jay Farrar</li>

<li>meet up w/ Kim and catch the show at &#8216;the empty space&#8217;. it&#8217;s good to see what nathan is up to</li>

<li>hang out with nathan after jen goes to sleep, get cds of &#8216;Blake&#8217;s Cinema&#8217;, it&#8217;s good to hear those tunes again. nathan is about the only person w/ a similar sense of humor, we can actually bounce ideas off one another and actually keep up</li>
</ul>

<p>wed (6/25)</p>

<ul>
<li>leave seattle, head east to Roslyn (where Northern Exposure was filmed)</li>

<li>nice drive, very pretty countryside</li>

<li>Roslyn was a great experience. I have such an emotional attachment to the characters and stories</li>

<li>lunch at &#8216;the Brick&#8217;, possibly the best french-fries of my life. It is indeed the coolest bar i&#8217;ve ever been to in my life. The only bar i&#8217;ve ever been where i truly wouldn&#8217;t mind hanging out. The played the best collection of music i&#8217;ve ever heard in a bar (uncle tupelo, phish, dar williams, allman brothers). It was a place that made me feel very content</li>

<li>sad to leave, but southward to portland</li>

<li>bit of a long drive, but beautiful countryside. I think the highest peak while driving was about 3000 ft. The little rental car was having some issues, but we made it ok</li>

<li>find the hotel in portland (the mark spencer), walk around near the hotel, find a fairly decent thai restaurant</li>

<li>head to powell&#8217;s city of books &#8230; an entire city block of books . . nirvanna</li>
</ul>

<p>thurs (6/26)</p>

<ul>
<li>walk the entierty of the city of portland, nice lunch in the downtown plaza</li>

<li>again, watch the boats on the river</li>

<li>back to powell&#8217;s at night, that store alone would be worth moving for</li>
</ul>

<p>fri (6/27)</p>

<ul>
<li>head out to washington park for the japanese gardens and the rose gardens</li>

<li>the public transportation is great, no problems at all</li>

<li>back to the downtown area, more walking, walking, walking</li>

<li>out to dinner and a tour of the portland underground for a pretty interesting history of the shanghai trade</li>

<li>pack up for the home trip</li>
</ul>

<p>sat (6/28)</p>

<ul>
<li>pack up, and than northward to SEA</li>

<li>plane is an hour late in leaving &#8230; stress . . the concert starts at 7:30, the flight is due to land at 6:20</li>

<li>flight lands around 7:00, after baggage and car location, we hit the road about 7:40</li>

<li>arrive about 10 minutes before peter gabriel takes the stage</li>

<li>amazing concert, thunderstorms and rain blowing into the pavilion</li>

<li>what a great way to end the vacation</li>
</ul>

<p>Set List:</p>

<ul>
<li>Red Rain</li>

<li>More Than This</li>

<li>Secret World</li>

</ul>

<p>the best vacation i&#8217;ve ever had. it was nice to not have to stress about money and just enjoy the time we had. It was great to see some friends from college, the one&#8217;s that really mattered, who actually supported all the goofy ideas i had, i miss them both very much.</p>
