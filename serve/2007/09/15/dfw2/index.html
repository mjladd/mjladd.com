    <p>Infinite Jest was a title that rang in my head for some reason, so I picked up the $5 British pressing paperback at Barne&#8217;s and Noble while looking for something of decent length to read on my first post-college vacation in spring of 1999. On the flight from Indianapolis to Seattle (via Detroit) I opened the massive novel and dived in.</p>

<p>One of my favorite memories of the trip was lying in the hostel in downtown Seattle and reading Infinite Jest. Just out of college and truly broke, there wasn&#8217;t a lot of night-time entertainment available.</p>

<p>I remember talking about David Foster Wallace with my friend Nathan when we stayed at his apartment where I read the first story of &#8216;A Supposedly Fun Thing I&#8217;ll Never Do Again&#8217; and I was taken. The rest of the vacation involved hunting through multiple used-book stores to purchase the rest of his work. I spend the rest of the summer reading everything I could find by him, finally finishing IJ at the music camp I worked at that year. I spend a Friday evening in the dorm room while the rest of the team went out drinking.Â  After finishing the book, I had to get out and socialize, albiet briefly, just to get out of my own head for awhile.</p>

<p>I remember reading &#8216;The Girl With Curious Hair&#8217; on the beach at Interlochen and finally ordering &#8216;Brief Interviews with Hideous Men&#8217; from Amazon when I had nothing left to consume.</p>

<p>Reading DFW made my brain echo in a funny but enjoyable way. The struggle and reach to comprehend was always worth the effort. It reminded me of the first time I heard Stravinsky and the opening bassoon of &#8216;The Rite of Spring&#8217; ran through my head like warm water. Something about it just fit my chemistry and made me care more about what sounds I heard (and with DFW, what words I read).</p>

<p>Last week I was rereading &#8216;Consider the Lobster&#8217; and surfing around to try and see if any new work was coming out. I&#8217;m looking forward to revisiting his work in the near future. The unfortunate passage is going to make the going a bit darker.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is water. This is water.&#8221; - DFW</p>
