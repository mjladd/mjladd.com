<p>Heading out of Skokie around 6:00 am and made it through the city with no issues. It was a smooth trip until reaching Merrillville when we saw a notice about an accident on I65. The interstate was closed several miles south so we took a detour through Crown Point down state road 55 and picked up I65 again in Roselawn.</p>

<p>Just a bit south of Lafayette we stopped at Jen&#8217;s friends house who was home working at her parents farm. I really miss the space in Indiana. I like being able to look out for miles in the distance over farmland.</p>

<p>After a short visit we were back on the highway. After a stop at Max and Erma&#8217;s we hit a couple of Half-Price bookstores and a children&#8217;s bookstore. Good thing that we&#8217;re driving this vacation since the trunk will likely be loaded with books by the time we get home.</p>

<p>We checked into the hotel and watched a bit of the White Sox/Cubs game before heading out to Bazbeaux Pizza. I only went there once in college, but I was able to take the folks there when they had the family reunion in Indianapolis and everyone seemed to like it.</p>

<p>We walked a bit around the Mass Ave area after having a pretty decent pizza at Bazbeaux. I like the area, it&#8217;s laid back and pretty casual. There&#8217;s a little jazz tavern called &#8216;Chatterbox&#8217; here that I like. Indy&#8217;s downtown area seems to be doing a bit better than it was the last time I was there, maybe three years ago. We decided to finish off the night at &#8216;Dave &amp; Buster&#8217;s&#8217;, playing air-hockey while catching the replay of the Sox game.</p>
