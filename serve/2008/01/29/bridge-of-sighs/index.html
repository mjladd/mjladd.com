<p>Finished &#8216;Bridge of Sighs&#8217; last night when I should have been working on homework.  For the second Russo novel in a row, I wish I stopped reading before the last 50 pages. As in &#8216;Empire Falls&#8217; the cliches stand out to the point of distraction. When the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Negro'>Magical Negro</a> appears I wanted to throw the book away. In &#8216;Empire Falls&#8217;, the school shooting made me mad enough to mark the page to know when to stop when I get the time to re-read it. Two great books that made me want to rip out 50 pages of them and put them back on the shelf.   &#8217;Bridge&#8217; was absolutely fantastic up to the appearance of &#8216;Miss Cleo&#8217; and I&#8217;m frustrated that I allow that small part to soil the rest of the book.</p>
