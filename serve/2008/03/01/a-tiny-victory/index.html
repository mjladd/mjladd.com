<p>Had a fantastic evening yesterday. Got out of work and picked up a quick meal before heading out to the library. It was great to have a couple of hours to simply think and knock out some work. I finished a paper for school and had some time to think and decompress.</p>

<p>Counting down the weeks of class (T-13) and can&#8217;t wait to be done. It certainly wasn&#8217;t what I hoped it would be, but it was a gamble like anything else, we&#8217;ll see how it pays off.</p>

<p>After the great night, I faced a work day of pounding my head with seemingly impossible problems of integrating Active Directory with a current ldap authentication plan. The current setup is riddled with enough security issues to keep me awake at night if I let myself think too much about it. Every bit of research turns up another block so research progress came up with a lot of options, and many of them troublesome. I feel like I&#8217;m starting to get an idea of what will need to be done, but the how is elusive. I&#8217;m very happy to work where I work and the challenges are great. I just have to keep focused on months down the line and how to get things to fall into place.</p>
