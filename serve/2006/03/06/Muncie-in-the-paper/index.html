  <h1>Muncie </h1>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="span10">
    <p>This weekend, the Chicago Tribune had an article that mentioned the current economic status of Muncie, IN. I had spent a good deal of the 90s attending school there at Ball State. It is a odd mix of a college town and a blue-collar town, where the college kids try to avoid the locals, and the locals blame everything bad on the school. Last summer Nathan and I made a quick drive-thru, and took a look around where I had spent so many years. I felt like my memories had to be wrong, that things weren&#8217;t this run-down and pitiful when I had attended school. It turns out I was probably correct, and things had gone down considerably since I had moved on. It reminded me of watching &#8216;Roger and Me&#8217;, Muncie was rapidly turning in to Flint, MI.</p>

<p>Muncie was actually a sizeable town in comparison to where I had grown up. Aside from a couple of trips to visit my friend Travis in Lafayette, I hadn&#8217;t spent any real time in a town that had actual sidewalks. I spend at least a two years of my Munice life walking around late at night on those sidewalks trying to make sense of things. I had worked at a local restaurant for nearly four years so I had a decent amount of interaction with the locals, and they really didn&#8217;t like the school or the types of folks that the school brought in.</p>

<p>Because of it&#8217;s &#8216;normalicy&#8217; for lack of a better word, Muncie was the subject of a sociological study in the late 1920&#8217;s, due to how &#8216;average&#8217; the population was. Being the home of Ball canning jars has not helped it keep up with the economic times, and the closing of the Delco plant, as well as a transmission plant that did work for GM have pretty much closed the doors on the town. These factory jobs that paid $25/hr are being replaced with Wal-Mart jobs that pay $9/hr. It was reported that the number of public school students on the free lunch program is now around 51%, with that number expected to grow fairly rapidly with one in four people living in poverty.</p>

<p>There was a point in my when I nearly ended up a permanent resident. Everything I had seemingly wanted was there; an available music studio where I could work for 80 hrs/week, a coffee shop, a decent library, and some small degree of culture with free concerts at the school. Luckily, I made some decisions that I had doubted at the time, but have all turned out for the best. I had an opportunity to do my PhD there, but at that point I had decided that I really needed to go somewhere else for school. It&#8217;s quite likely that I had the blinders of youth on when I lived there. It didn&#8217;t matter that I was getting by on $430/mo and staying in a crappy apartment with no air-conditioning, and barely workable heating. I was doing what I wanted to do, and the environment was inconsequential.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s sad to see something from my youth fall apart. It makes me doubt the very memories that make up that time period. This was the time where I think I discovered who I really was, and what I was capable of doing. I&#8217;m not sure I would have ever came as far as I have without getting out of my hometown and growing up on my own.</p>
