    <p>I&#8217;m about 99% positive that most of the progress I&#8217;ve made in my life is due to my teachers. Not the good ones (there were a few, but not enough), but the bad ones. The awful, lazy teachers who did nothing but make me want to have the revenge of living well. I can think of two math instructors I had who worked hard and tried to communicate, and I did great in those classes .. but the rest mostly walked through the same lesson plans they used for decades.</p>

<p>Why am I studying math at home while my wife and newborn sleep? Because I had teachers who cared so little for instruction and doing anything beyond going through the motions that they left me with almost no interest and a lot of fear of my own ignorance. Revenge for me was failing math in high school, but getting a minor in applied physics. That minor was hard won, and I had some really lousy teachers in college as well, but I had enough anger to get me through.</p>

<p>Luckily, the teachers were bad, but not bad enough to kill my interest, or maybe they just made me mad enough to keep going. Even as I kid I knew what they were doing was wrong and they were cheating their students. I think alot about where I came from and how much work it took to get out. I&#8217;m not very smart, but I have enough anger to make me work hard, and that seems to be what was needed to progress, move forward and escape. I&#8217;m not successful, but I&#8217;m further along they I should be. I gave up a lot of sleep to end up with a decent job and I have great parents who supported me. But I don&#8217;t think anything motivated me more than frustration.</p>

<p>Along the way there was a lot of &#8221;I&#8217;ll show you&#8221;, but that&#8217;s tempered now. I did do it and now I have to take advantage of what I have. I can look back and let myself off the hook .. but just a little. Just enough to appreciate what I have, but not to get slow and lazy. I feel lucky, but it&#8217;s been an earned luck.</p>

<p>I like to read this McNally <a href='http://southeastreview.org/onlineissue1/mcnally.php'>writeup</a> on a regular basis. T.C. Boyle says it best, &#8220;Bury your enemies, and bury &#8216;em deep&#8221;.</p>
